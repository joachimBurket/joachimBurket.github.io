This GitHub page's main goal is to easily store and reuse tips while I'm working on different projects. 

These tips are freely shared, but come of course without warranty. If you see inconsistances or mistakes, don't hesitate to write it in an [issue](https://github.com/joachimBurket/joachimBurket.github.io/issues){:.external}{:target="_blank"}, or make a [pull request](https://github.com/joachimBurket/joachimBurket.github.io/pulls){:.external}{:target="_blank"} on my repository. I would gladly make the change.


## About me

I'm a Software engineer living in Switzerland. I did an apprenticeship as an electronician that I finished in 2014. Then I interested myself in higher level technologies, and finished a bachelor in network and security in 2017. I was still interested in embedded systems, especialy under custom Linux OS, and in 2018 I started a Master in Mobile and Embedded systems, which I finished in 2020.

I am now working as a Software engineer, doing mostly Python under the Django Framework in a Network team, but I'am still doing projects on embedded systems for myself. I recently discovered the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){:.external}{:target="_blank"} language, which really excites me as a substitute for C and C++ in embedded systems.


### Experiences

Some projects done during my studies.

* **Cross-Country ski tracks quality monitoring**

    During my Bachelor thesis, I have developped a solution that allows cross-country skiers from the [NRGi](https://www.nrgi.ch/){:.external}{:target="_blank"} to see in live the quality of the different tracks.

    When the groomer is making the tracks, an embedded system send its position to the server, which then updates the tracks last groom. The skiers can then see the tracks quality on a [map](https://track.nrgi.ch/){:.external}{:target="_blank"}, with different colors depending on the last time the groomer is passed.

* **Image processing on ESP32**

    During my Master, I ported the image processing library [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/){:.external}{:target="_blank"} on an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32){:.external}{:target="_blank"}, and optimized a gauge detection algorithm to run on this device. 
    
    The port of OpenCV is available on this [repository](https://github.com/joachimBurket/esp32-opencv){:.external}{:target="_blank"}.
