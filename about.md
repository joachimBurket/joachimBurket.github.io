## Experiences

### Cross-Country ski tracks quality monitoring

During my Bachelor thesis, I have developped a solution that allows cross-country skiers from the [NRGi](https://www.nrgi.ch/) to see in live the quality of the different tracks.

When the groomer is grooming the tracks, an embedded system send its position to the server, which then updates the tracks last groom. The skiers can then see the tracks quality on a [map](https://track.nrgi.ch/), with different colors depending on the last time the groomer is passed.
