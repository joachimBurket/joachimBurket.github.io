Timezone management in Django is not straightforward. This is a recap of what to be aware of when playing with them.

When using a MySQL DB, the datetime fields are stored without any information about the timezone. This is prone to errors implies to be careful to always store datetime into the same timezone (UTC is a good idea, but another is possible as long as the same one is always used).

In Django [settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings), there are two parameters to configure the Timezone problem: [TIME_ZONE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#std:setting-TIME_ZONE) and [USE_TZ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#use-tz).

`TIME_ZONE` configures the project timezone, which will be used as follow depending on `USE_TZ`:
* When `USE_TZ=False`, Django will store all datetime in `TIME_ZONE` on the DB. For example, `2021-04-21T14:01:56.449815+02:00` will be stored as `2021-04-21T14:01:56.449815` on the DB.
* When `USE_TZ=True`, Django will store all datetim in UTC on the DB. For example, `2021-04-21T14:01:56.449815+02:00` will be stored as `2021-04-21T12:01:56.449815` on the DB. 
  With this option enabled, Django will also use `TIME_ZONE` to display datetimes in templates and to interpret datetimes entered in forms.
