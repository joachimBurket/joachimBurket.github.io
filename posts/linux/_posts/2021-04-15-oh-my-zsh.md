Installation and configurations of an [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/){:.external}{:target="_blank"} shell with p10k theme.

<!--more-->

## Installation

Oh-my-zsh gives an installation script:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Configurations

### Theme

Because I like fancy icons and colors in my shell, I installed the [p10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) zsh theme. Here are the steps to install it:

1. Cloning the repository in oh-my-zsh custom themes folder:

    ```bash
    $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    ```

2. Setting `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in `~/.zshrc` file and restarting Zsh

3. Installing `Meslo Nerd Font` in the OS fonts:

    * see [this page](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k) for the installation

    * Setting the font as default in the terminal settings (depends on the terminal)

    * If using VSCode, adding this line to the `settings.json`:
    
        ```json
        "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF"
        ```

4. Launching p10k theme configuration tool:

    ```bash
    $ p10k configure
    ```

### Plugins

There are loads of [plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins) for oh-my-zsh.

Here are the plugins configured in my `zshrc`:

```
plugins=(
    git
    sudo
    docker
    zsh-autosuggestions
    zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```

* **git**: Provides [aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git#aliases) (e.g. `gst` for `git status`) and a few useful [functions](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git#functions)
* **sudo**: Easily prefix your current or previous commands with `sudo` by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> twice
* **docker**: Adds auto-completion for docker
* **zsh-autosuggestions**: Suggests commands as you type based on history and completions
* **zsh-syntax-highlighting**: Highlights the shell commands whilst they are typed


Some plugins need to be installed into the oh-my-zsh custom themes folder:

* *[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)*:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
    ```

* *[zsh-syntax-highlight](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)*: 

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
    ```

### Zshrc

Some configurations I find useful in the `zshrc` file:

```bash
# TODO
alias ll="ls -alhF"
```
