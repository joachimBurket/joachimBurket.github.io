## Installation

To install lnav on Linux:

```bash
# On debian based distrib
sudo apt install lnav

# On fedora/centos/rhel distrib
sudo yum install lnav
```

Check the installed version

```bash
lnav -V
```

## Usage

Launch lnav on a log file with:

```bash
# Open `/var/log/messages` log file
lnav /var/log/messages

# Open all the `/var/log/messages` log files, including the archived ones (e.g. `messages-2023-02-19`)
lnav /var/log/messages*
```

Useful hotkeys in lnav:

* `?`: open lnav help
* `q`: quit the current view, or lnav
* `/`: start a search
* `:`: execute an lnav command
* `=`: Pause/unpause logs loading
* `Ctrl`+`r`: Reset the current session state (includes filters, bookmarks, hidden fields)
* `PgUp` / `PgDn`: Up/Down a page
* `Home` / `End`: Top/Bottom of the opened logs
* `e` / `Shift`+`e`: Next/Previous error
* `0` / `Shift`+`0`: Next/Previous day

The full list can be found in the [hotkeys doc](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/hotkeys.html).

### Search

To search in the logs, type the key `/` in lnav, followed by a regex of the search:

```bash
# search my-service in the logs
/my-service

# search an ipv4 addr in the logs
/(\b25[0-5]|\b2[0-4][0-9]|\b[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}
```

### Commands

To start a command, type `:` in lnav. The commands history can be navigated with the `up` and `down`arrows.

Some useful commands:

* `filter-in <regex>`: Show only logs that match the regex
* `filter-out <regex>`: Don't show logs that match the regex
* `disable-filter <regex>`: Disable a filter created
* `hide-lines-before` and `hide-lines-after`: Hide lines before/after a date (e.g. `hide-line-before 6am` to hide logs before today 6am)
* `set-min-log-level <level>`: Set the minimum log level to view (can be `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
* `write-raw-to <filename>`: write logs (example concatenated logs with filters) to another file. Starting with lnav version `0.11.1`, an option `--anonymize` allows to anonymize the IP addresses, URLs, MAC addresses, emails, etc... to share logs.

Commands generally support the `TAB` completion.
