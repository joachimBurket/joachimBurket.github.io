This page is a cheatsheet for [systemd](https://systemd.io/) commands and configurations.

<!--more-->

First of all, systemd man pages are very usefull:

```bash
### Systemd concepts and description ###
$ man systemd


### Systemd service file description ###

# Description of a unit configuration file (general):
$ man systemd.unit

# Description of the service specific configurations:
$ man systemd.service

### Systemctl command that controls systemd
$ man systemctl
```

`systemd.unit` describes the common configurations of a unit file. In systemd, a unit can be a service, a socket, a device, a mount point, etc... In addition to this man page, there is a unit specific man page, for instance `systemd.service`, `systemd.socket`, `systemd.device`, etc...


## Commands

* Starting/Stopping and getting the status of a service:
    
    ```bash
    $ systemctl start|restart|stop|status ServiceName
    ```

* Enable/Disable a service to start on boot:
    
    ```bash
    $ systemctl enable|disable ServiceName
    ```

* Show properties of a service:
    
    ```bash
    $ systemctl show ServiceName
    ```

* List all systemd units and their state: 

    ```bash
    $ systemctl list-units
    ```

* Show services logs:
    
    ```bash
    # all services logs
    $ journalctl

    # a specific service 
    $ journalctl -u ServiceName 

    # follow a service logs 
    $ journalctl -u ServiceName -f
    ```

* Reload systemd services (needed when a modification is done on a service file):

    ```bash
    $ systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

* See how long every services take a boot time:

    ```bash
    $ systemd-analyze blame
    ```

## Services configurations

In order to create a new systemd service, create a file in `/etc/systemd/system/`. For instance, `servicename.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My demo service
After=network.target
Requires=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=MyUser
Group=MyGroup
ExecStart=/usr/bin/myservice.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The service file configuration file is separated into three sections:

* `[Unit]`: This section describes common unit configurations, like:
    * `Before=`/`After=` : Services before/after which our service is started  
    * `Requires=` : Services without whom our service won't start 
    * `PartOf=` : If the services listed here are stopped or restarted, the action is propagated to our service
    * `StartLimitIntervalSec=`, `StartLimitBurst=` : If the service is restarted more than `Burst` time within an `Interval`, systemd will stop trying to restart it. If we want to restart for ever, set the `StartLimitIntervalSec=0`.
    * etc...

* `[Service]`: Configuration options specific to a service, like:
    * `Restart=always` : Service always restart on failure 
    * `RestartSec=` : Number of seconds systemd waits before restarting our service
    * `ExecStart=`, `ExecReload=`, `ExecStop=` : Executable to start\|restart\|stop our service 
    * `ExecStartPre=`, `ExecStartPost=`, `ExecStopPost=` : Action to do before/after start and after stop 
    * `User=`, `Group=` : User/Group with which the service is started
    * `Type=`: simple\|forking\|oneshot\|notify\|idle
    * etc...

* `[Install]`: Contains installation information for the unit. These information are used by `enable` and `disable` commands. For example:
    * `WantedBy=`, `RequiredBy=`: Dependency of type `Wants=` or `Requires=` added to the services listed.


To install and start the service we created, type those commands:

```bash
# reload service configuration file
$ systemctl daemon-reload

# if must start at boot
$ systemctl enable myservice 

# start the service
$ systemctl start myservice

# get service status 
$ systemctl status myservice

```
