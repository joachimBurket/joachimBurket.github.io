<p>Some cheatsheets I've made while learning programming languages. 
They are intended to be printed in a "boolket" format, and be kept beside
the keyboard while coding.</p>

<ul>
  {% for cheatsheet in site.cheatsheets %}
    <li>
      <p><a href="{{ cheatsheet.url }}">{{ cheatsheet.title }}</a></p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
