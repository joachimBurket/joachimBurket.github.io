# My website repo

This is my [github page](https://joachimburket.github.io) repository. I'm using it to store some tips on experiences I had.

## Build

The website is built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ to install the tools needed to build the site.

The `docs/` folder contains the website content. To locally build and serve it, run the `serve.sh` script. 

```bash
./serve.sh
```
